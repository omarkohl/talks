Python Design Patterns
======================

Talk given at the Python User Group Freiburg (Germany) in March 2017.

The slides were made with reveal.js version 3.4.1 .

To view the slides including speaker notes:

```bash
cd slides
npm install
npm start
# open http://localhost:8000
# hit 's' on your keyboard to view the speaker notes
```

Alternatively just open *slides/index.html* with a browser and you'll see the
slides (without speaker notes) or have a look at the exported PDF version.

All Python examples were tested with Python 3.4 (unless indicated otherwise).
